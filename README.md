## 🛠️ My Favorite Tools

Here are the tools that power my daily workflow and boost my productivity:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33" align="center">

### ⌨️ [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)
**Hyperextensible Text Editor**

The modern evolution of Vim, built for extensibility and usability. My configuration transforms it into a full-featured IDE with LSP support, fuzzy finding, and custom keybindings tailored to my workflow.

*Perfect for: Code editing, configuration management, and terminal-based development*

### 📁 [Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/)
**Terminal File Manager**

A blazing fast terminal file manager written in Rust. Combines vim-like keybindings with modern features like image previews and async operations.

*Perfect for: Large directory navigation, file operations, and terminal workflows*

### 🧠 [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
**Knowledge Management**

My second brain for connecting ideas, managing projects, and building comprehensive documentation. The graph view and bidirectional linking make knowledge discovery effortless.

*Perfect for: Technical documentation, project planning, and learning*

</td>
<td width="33%" align="center">

### 🚀 [Warp.dev](https://app.warp.dev/referral/GVGXKK)
**The AI-Powered Terminal**

The modern terminal that feels like an IDE. **However,** for my use case, I disable the included AI features. While it is a great tool for AI-driven development, I prefer to use it for its original purpose: as an intuitive modern terminal, written in Rust.

*Perfect for: Complex workflows, debugging, and remote sessions using the "warpified" SSH*
